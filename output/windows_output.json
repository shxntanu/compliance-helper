        "Description": "This policy setting determines the number of renewed, unique passwords that have to \nbe associated with a user account before you can reuse an old password. The value for \nthis policy setting must be between 0 and 24 passwords. The default value for stand-\nalone systems is 0 passwords, but the default setting when joined to a domain is 24 \npasswords. To maintain the effectiveness of this policy setting, use the Minimum \npassword age setting to prevent users from repeatedly changing their password. \nThe recommended state for this setting is: 24 or more password(s). \nNote: Password Policy settings (section 1.1) and Account Lockout Policy settings \n(section 1.2) must be applied via the Default Domain Policy GPO in order to be \nglobally in effect on domain user accounts as their default behavior. If these settings \nare configured in another GPO, they will only affect local user accounts on the \ncomputers that receive the GPO. However, custom exceptions to the default password \npolicy and account lockout policy rules for specific domain users and/or groups can be \ndefined using Password Settings Objects (PSOs), which are completely separate from \nGroup Policy and most easily configured using Active Directory Administrative Center. \nNote #2: As of the publication of this benchmark, Microsoft currently has a maximum \nlimit of 24 saved passwords. For more information, please visit Enforce password \nhistory (Windows 10) - Windows security | Microsoft Docs",
        "Rationale": "The longer a user uses the same password, the greater the chance that an attacker can \ndetermine the password through brute force attacks. Also, any accounts that may have \nbeen compromised will remain exploitable for as long as the password is left \nunchanged. If password changes are required but password reuse is not prevented, or if \nusers continually reuse a small number of passwords, the effectiveness of a good \npassword policy is greatly reduced. \nIf you specify a low number for this policy setting, users will be able to use the same \nsmall number of passwords repeatedly. If you do not also configure the Minimum \npassword age setting, users might repeatedly change their passwords until they can \nreuse their original password. \n \n \nImpact: \nThe major impact of this configuration is that users must create a new password every \ntime they are required to change their old one. If users are required to change their \npasswords to new unique values, there is an increased risk of users who write their \npasswords somewhere so that they do not forget them. Another risk is that users may \ncreate passwords that change incrementally (for example, password01, password02, \nand so on) to facilitate memorization but make them easier to guess. Also, an \nexcessively low value for the Minimum password age setting will likely increase \nadministrative overhead, because users who forget their passwords might ask the help \ndesk to reset them frequently.",

Such a configuration can reduce security in the organization, \nbecause users might write their passwords in an insecure location or lose them.

To address password reuse a combination of \nsecurity settings is required. Using this policy setting with the Enforce password history \nsetting prevents the easy reuse of old passwords. For example, if you configure the \nEnforce password history setting to ensure that users cannot reuse any of their last 12 \npasswords, they could change their password 13 times in a few minutes and reuse the \npassword they started with, unless you also configure the Minimum password age \nsetting to a number that is greater than 0. You must configure this policy setting to a \nnumber that is greater than 0 for the Enforce password history setting to be effective. \nImpact: \nIf an administrator sets a password for a user but wants that user to change the \npassword when the user first logs on, the administrator must select the User must \nchange password at next logon check box, or the user will not be able to change the \npassword until the next day.",

There are many different theories about how to determine the best \npassword length for an organization, but perhaps \"passphrase\" is a better term than \n\"password.\" In Microsoft Windows 2000 or newer, passphrases can be quite long and \ncan include spaces. Therefore, a phrase such as \"I want to drink a $5 milkshake\" is a \nvalid passphrase; it is a considerably stronger password than an 8 or 10 character string \nof random numbers and letters, and yet is easier to remember. Users must be educated \nabout the proper selection and maintenance of passwords, especially around password \nlength. In enterprise environments, the ideal value for the Minimum password length \nsetting is 14 characters, however you should adjust this value to meet your \norganization's business requirements. \nThe recommended state for this setting is: 14 or more character(s). \nNote: In Windows Server 2016 and older versions of Windows Server, the GUI of the \nLocal Security Policy (LSP), Local Group Policy Editor (LGPE) and Group Policy \nManagement Editor (GPME) would not let you set this value higher than 14 characters. \nHowever, starting with Windows Server 2019, Microsoft changed the GUI to allow up to \na 20 character minimum password length. \nNote #2: Password Policy settings (section 1.1) and Account Lockout Policy settings \n(section 1.2) must be applied via the Default Domain Policy GPO in order to be \nglobally in effect on domain user accounts as their default behavior. If these settings \nare configured in another GPO, they will only affect local user accounts on the \ncomputers that receive the GPO. However, custom exceptions to the default password \npolicy and account lockout policy rules for specific domain users and/or groups can be \ndefined using Password Settings Objects (PSOs), which are completely separate from \nGroup Policy and most easily configured using Active Directory Administrative Center. \nRationale: \nTypes of password attacks include dictionary attacks (which attempt to use common \nwords and phrases) and brute force attacks (which try every possible combination of \ncharacters). Also, attackers sometimes try to obtain the account database so they can \nuse tools to discover the accounts and passwords. \n \n \n \n \nImpact: \nRequirements for extremely long passwords can actually decrease the security of an \norganization, because users might leave the information in an insecure location or lose \nit. If very long passwords are required, mistyped passwords could cause account \nlockouts and increase the volume of help desk calls. If your organization has issues with \nforgotten passwords due to password length requirements, consider teaching your \nusers about passphrases, which are often easier to remember and, due to the larger \nnumber of character combinations, much harder to discover. \nNote: Older versions of Windows such as Windows 98 and Windows NT 4.0 do not \nsupport passwords that are longer than 14 characters. Computers that run these older \noperating systems are unable to authenticate with computers or domains that use \naccounts that require long passwords. \nAudit: \nNavigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as \nprescribed. \nRemediation: \nTo establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to 14 or \nmore character(s): \nComputer Configuration\\Policies\\Windows Settings\\Security Settings\\Account \nPolicies\\Password Policy\\Minimum password length \nDefault Value: \n7 characters on domain members. 0 characters on stand-alone servers. \nReferences: \n1. https://www.cisecurity.org/white-papers/cis-password-policy-guide/ \nCIS Controls: \nControls \nVersion \nControl \nIG 1 IG 2 IG 3 \nv8 \n5.2 Use Unique Passwords \n \nUse unique passwords for all enterprise assets.

        "Description": "This policy setting checks all new passwords to ensure that they meet basic \nrequirements for strong passwords. \nWhen this policy is enabled, passwords must meet the following minimum requirements: \n\u2022 \nNot contain the user's account name or parts of the user's full name that exceed \ntwo consecutive characters \n\u2022 \nBe at least six characters in length \n\u2022 \nContain characters from three of the following categories: \no English uppercase characters (A through Z) \no English lowercase characters (a through z) \no Base 10 digits (0 through 9) \no Non-alphabetic characters (for example, !, $, #, %) \no A catch-all category of any Unicode character that does not fall under the \nprevious four categories. This fifth category can be regionally specific. \nEach additional character in a password increases its complexity exponentially. For \ninstance, a seven-character, all lower-case alphabetic password would have 26 to the \npower of 7 (approximately 8 x 10 to the power of 9 or 8 billion) possible combinations. \nAt 1,000,000 attempts per second (a capability of many password-cracking utilities), it \nwould only take 133 minutes to crack. A seven-character alphabetic password with case \nsensitivity has 52 to the power of 7 combinations. A seven-character case-sensitive \nalphanumeric password without punctuation has 62 to the power of 7 combinations. An \neight-character password has 26 to the power of 8 (or 2 x 1011) possible combinations. \nAlthough this might seem to be a large number, at 1,000,000 attempts per second it \nwould take only 59 hours to try all possible passwords. Remember, these times will \nsignificantly increase for passwords that use ALT characters and other special keyboard \ncharacters such as \"!\" or \"@\". Proper use of the password settings can help make it \ndifficult to mount a brute force attack. \nThe recommended state for this setting is: Enabled. \n \n \n \n \nNote: Password Policy settings (section 1.1) and Account Lockout Policy settings \n(section 1.2) must be applied via the Default Domain Policy GPO in order to be \nglobally in effect on domain user accounts as their default behavior.

        "Rationale": "Passwords that contain only alphanumeric characters are extremely easy to discover \nwith several publicly available tools. \nImpact: \nIf the default password complexity configuration is retained, additional help desk calls \nfor locked-out accounts could occur because users might not be accustomed to \npasswords that contain non-alphabetic characters. However, all users should be able to \ncomply with the complexity requirement with minimal difficulty. \nIf your organization has more stringent security requirements, you can create a custom \nversion of the Passfilt.dll file that allows the use of arbitrarily complex password strength \nrules. For example, a custom password filter might require the use of non-upper row \ncharacters. (Upper row characters are those that require you to hold down the SHIFT \nkey and press any of the digits between 1 and 0.) A custom password filter might also \nperform a dictionary check to verify that the proposed password does not contain \ncommon dictionary words or fragments. \nAlso, the use of ALT key character combinations can greatly enhance the complexity of \na password. However, such stringent password requirements can result in unhappy \nusers and an extremely busy help desk. Alternatively, your organization could consider \na requirement for all administrator passwords to use ALT characters in the 0128 - 0159 \nrange. (ALT characters outside of this range can represent standard alphanumeric \ncharacters that would not add additional complexity to the password.)",

Also, because the Kerberos authentication protocol \nrequires that the requestor and authenticator have their clocks synchronized within an \nadministrator-defined skew period, an attacker who changes a computer's time may \ncause that computer to be unable to obtain or grant Kerberos tickets. \nThe risk from these types of events is mitigated on most Domain Controllers, Member \nServers, and end-user computers because the Windows Time service automatically \nsynchronizes time with Domain Controllers in the following ways: \n\u2022 \nAll client desktop computers and Member Servers use the authenticating Domain \nController as their inbound time partner. \n\u2022 \nAll Domain Controllers in a domain nominate the Primary Domain Controller \n(PDC) Emulator operations master as their inbound time partner. \n\u2022 \nAll PDC Emulator operations masters follow the hierarchy of domains in the \nselection of their inbound time partner. \n\u2022 \nThe PDC Emulator operations master at the root of the domain is authoritative for \nthe organization. Therefore it is recommended that you configure this computer \nto synchronize with a reliable external time server. \nThis vulnerability becomes much more serious if an attacker is able to change the \nsystem time and then stop the Windows Time service or reconfigure it to synchronize \nwith a time server that is not accurate. \nImpact: \nThere should be no impact, because time synchronization for most organizations should \nbe fully automated for all computers that belong to the domain.

        "Rationale": "Requiring Channel Binding Tokens (CBT) can prevent an attacker who is able to \ncapture users' authentication credentials (e.g. OAuth tokens, session identifiers, etc.) \nfrom reusing those credentials in another TLS session. This also helps to increase \nprotection against \"man-in-the-middle\" attacks using LDAP authentication over SSL/TLS \n(LDAPS). \n \n \n \n \nImpact: \nAll LDAP clients must provide channel binding information over SSL/TLS (i.e. LDAPS). \nThe LDAP server (Domain Controller) rejects authentication requests from clients that \ndo not do so. Clients must have the CVC-2017-8563 security update to support this \nfeature, and may have compatibility issues with this setting without the security update. \nThis may also mean that LDAP authentication requests over SSL/TLS that previously \nworked may stop working until the security update is installed. \nWhen first deploying this setting, you may initially want to only set it to the alternate \nsetting of When supported (instead of Always) on all Domain Controllers.

This new Event ID requires \nincreasing the logging level of the 16 LDAP Interface Events portion of the NTDS \nservice diagnostics to a value of 2 (Basic).

To lower the risk of such an intrusion in an organization's network, you can \nimplement strong physical security measures to protect the network infrastructure. Also, \nyou could implement Internet Protocol security (IPsec) authentication header mode \n(AH), which performs mutual authentication and packet integrity for IP traffic to make all \ntypes of man-in-the-middle attacks extremely difficult. \nAdditionally, allowing the use of regular, unsigned LDAP permits credentials to be \nreceived over the network in clear text, which could very easily result in the interception \nof account passwords by other systems on the network. \n \n \n \n \nImpact: \nUnless TLS/SSL is being used, the LDAP data signing option must be negotiated. \nClients that do not support LDAP signing will be unable to run LDAP queries against the \nDomain Controllers.

For domain accounts, this \nsecurity setting determines whether it is necessary to contact a Domain Controller to \nunlock a computer. \nThe recommended state for this setting is: Enabled. \nRationale: \nBy default, the computer caches in memory the credentials of any users who are \nauthenticated locally.

When cached credentials are used, any \nchanges that have recently been made to the account \u2014 such as user rights \nassignments, account lockout, or the account being disabled \u2014 are not considered or \napplied after the account is authenticated. User privileges are not updated, and (more \nimportantly) disabled accounts are still able to unlock the console of the computer. \nImpact: \nWhen the console on a computer is locked, either by a user or automatically by a \nscreen saver time-out, the console can only be unlocked if a Domain Controller is \navailable to re-authenticate the domain account that is being used to unlock the \ncomputer.

        "Rationale": "Users sometimes forget to lock their workstations when they are away from them, \nallowing the possibility for malicious users to access their computers. If smart cards are \nused for authentication, the computer should automatically lock itself when the card is \nremoved to ensure that only the user with the smart card is accessing resources using \nthose credentials. \nImpact: \nIf you select Lock Workstation, the workstation is locked when the smart card is \nremoved, allowing users to leave the area, take their smart card with them, and still \nmaintain a protected session. \nIf you select Force Logoff, users are automatically logged off when their smart card is \nremoved. \nIf you select Disconnect if a Remote Desktop Services session, removal of the smart \ncard disconnects the session without logging the users off. This allows the user to insert \nthe smart card and resume the session later, or at another smart card reader-equipped \ncomputer, without having to log on again. If the session is local, this policy will function \nidentically to Lock Workstation. \nEnforcing this setting on computers used by people who must log onto multiple \ncomputers in order to perform their duties could be frustrating and lower productivity. \nFor example, if network administrators are limited to a single account but need to log \ninto several computers simultaneously in order to effectively manage the network \nenforcing this setting will limit them to logging onto one computer at a time.

The SMB \nprotocol supports validating the SMB server service principal name (SPN) within the \nauthentication blob provided by a SMB client to prevent a class of attacks against SMB \nservers referred to as SMB relay attacks. This setting will affect both SMB1 and SMB2. \nThe recommended state for this setting is: Accept if provided by client. Configuring \nthis setting to Required from client also conforms to the benchmark. \nNote: Since the release of the MS KB3161561 security patch, this setting can cause \nsignificant issues (such as replication problems, group policy editing issues and blue \nscreen crashes) on Domain Controllers when used simultaneously with UNC path \nhardening (i.e. Rule 18.5.14.1).

If the SPN does NOT match, the session \nrequest for that SMB client will be denied. \nIf configured to Required from client, the SMB client MUST send a SPN name in \nsession setup, and the SPN name provided MUST match the SMB server that is being \nrequested to establish a connection.

        "Description": "LAN Manager (LM) was a family of early Microsoft client/server software (predating \nWindows NT) that allowed users to link personal computers together on a single \nnetwork. LM network capabilities included transparent file and print sharing, user \nsecurity features, and network administration tools. In Active Directory domains, the \nKerberos protocol is the default authentication protocol. However, if the Kerberos \nprotocol is not negotiated for some reason, Active Directory will use LM, NTLM, or \nNTLMv2. LAN Manager authentication includes the LM, NTLM, and NTLM version 2 \n(NTLMv2) variants, and is the protocol that is used to authenticate all Windows clients \nwhen they perform the following operations: \n\u2022 \nJoin a domain \n\u2022 \nAuthenticate between Active Directory forests \n\u2022 \nAuthenticate to down-level domains \n\u2022 \nAuthenticate to computers that do not run Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003, \nor Windows XP \n\u2022 \nAuthenticate to computers that are not in the domain \nThe Network security: LAN Manager authentication level setting determines which \nchallenge/response authentication protocol is used for network logons. This choice \naffects the level of authentication protocol used by clients, the level of session security \nnegotiated, and the level of authentication accepted by servers. \nThe recommended state for this setting is: Send NTLMv2 response only. Refuse LM & \nNTLM.",
        "Rationale": "Windows 2000 and Windows XP clients were configured by default to send LM and \nNTLM authentication responses (Windows 95-based and Windows 98-based clients \nonly send LM). The default settings in OSes predating Windows Vista / Windows Server \n2008 (non-R2) allowed all clients to authenticate with servers and use their resources. \nHowever, this meant that LM responses - the weakest form of authentication response - \nwere sent over the network, and it was potentially possible for attackers to sniff that \ntraffic to more easily reproduce the user's password. \nThe Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT operating systems cannot use the \nKerberos version 5 protocol for authentication. For this reason, in a Windows Server \n2003 domain, these computers authenticate by default with both the LM and NTLM \nprotocols for network authentication. You can enforce a more secure authentication \nprotocol for Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT by using NTLMv2. For the \nlogon process, NTLMv2 uses a secure channel to protect the authentication process. \nEven if you use NTLMv2 for older clients and servers, Windows-based clients and \nservers that are members of the domain will use the Kerberos authentication protocol to \nauthenticate with Windows Server 2003 or newer Domain Controllers. For these \nreasons, it is strongly preferred to restrict the use of LM & NTLM (non-v2) as much as \npossible. \nImpact: \nClients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server \nsupports it; Domain Controllers refuse LM and NTLM (accept only NTLMv2 \nauthentication). Clients that do not support NTLMv2 authentication will not be able to \nauthenticate in the domain and access domain resources by using LM and NTLM.",

To lower this risk in your network, you can implement strong physical security \nmeasures to protect the network infrastructure.

However, if you choose instead to configure the \nserver to require LDAP signatures then you must also configure the client. If you do not \nconfigure the client it will not be able to communicate with the server, which could cause \nmany features to fail, including user authentication, Group Policy, and logon scripts, \nbecause the caller will be told that the LDAP BIND command request failed.",
